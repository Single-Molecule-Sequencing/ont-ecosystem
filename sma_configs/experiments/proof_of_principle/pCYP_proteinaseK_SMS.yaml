notes: |
  Proof-of-principle experiment series for ProteinaseK treatment of pCYP plasmid.
  Multiple attempts (try1-5) with different conditions.
  Uses Flongle flow cell (FLO-FLG114) for rapid iterations.
  Data stored on Great Lakes HPC.
  Config created from remote metadata discovery - verify paths on HPC.
