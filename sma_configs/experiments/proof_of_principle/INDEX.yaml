notes: |
  These proof-of-principle experiments were conducted before the main SMA-seq
  manuscript experiments. They explore various cutting and preparation methods:

  1. Cas9 targeting (cas9_exon2)
  2. Restriction enzymes (Eco53kI, SRF1, PvuII)
  3. Enzyme treatments (ProteinaseK)
  4. Barcoding strategies (rapid barcoding 24)

  Data stored on Great Lakes HPC. Access requires UMich credentials.
  Configs created from remote metadata discovery - verify on HPC before use.
