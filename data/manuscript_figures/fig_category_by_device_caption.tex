\textbf{Distribution of sample categories across sequencing device platforms.}
Stacked bar chart showing the relationship between device selection and experimental application. MinION Mk1D (n=81) serves as the primary workhorse for plasmid sequencing and general research applications. Standard MinION devices (n=36) are similarly dominated by plasmid work. PromethION (n=29) shows diverse usage including human genomics, pharmacogenomics, and research applications, reflecting its higher throughput capacity for complex samples. P2 Solo (n=9) is exclusively used for pharmacogenomics studies, while Flongle (n=4) serves specialized microbial applications.
