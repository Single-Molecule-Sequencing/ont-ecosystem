\caption[Device Type vs Basecall Model]{%
\textbf{Relationship between sequencing device type and basecalling model selection.}
Heatmap showing the distribution of basecalling models (hac, sup, fast) across device platforms. MinION Mk1D devices predominantly use high-accuracy (hac) models (n=78), reflecting routine laboratory sequencing workflows. PromethION experiments show notable adoption of super-accuracy (sup) models (n=12), likely for applications requiring maximum base-calling precision such as pharmacogenomics and human variant calling. The fast model is primarily used on Mk1D (n=3) and Flongle (n=2) devices for rapid, low-complexity applications.
