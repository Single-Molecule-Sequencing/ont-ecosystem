\textbf{Overview of the Oxford Nanopore sequencing experiment registry.}
The registry contains 165 validated experiments with comprehensive metadata.
\textbf{(A)}~Sample category distribution showing plasmid sequencing as the dominant application (n=80, 48.5\%), followed by research projects (n=39, 23.6\%), human samples (n=16, 9.7\%), and pharmacogenomics studies (n=13, 7.9\%).
\textbf{(B)}~Chemistry version distribution demonstrating near-universal adoption of R10.4.1 chemistry (95.2\%), with legacy R10.4 comprising the remainder.
\textbf{(C)}~Device type breakdown across MinION Mk1D (n=81), MinION (n=36), PromethION (n=29), P2 Solo (n=9), and Flongle (n=4) platforms.
\textbf{(D)}~Basecalling model usage showing predominant use of high-accuracy (hac) models (89.7\%), with super-accuracy (sup) models at 7.3\% and fast models at 3.0\%.
\textbf{(E)}~Basecaller software distribution indicating dorado as the primary basecaller (82.4\%), reflecting the transition from guppy (8.5\%) in modern workflows.
\textbf{(F)}~Summary statistics for quality control metrics across experiments with available data, including mean Q-score (median: 14.0), N50 read length (median: 4,828~bp), and total read counts (median: 320,738 reads).
