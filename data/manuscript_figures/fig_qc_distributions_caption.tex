\caption[Quality Control Metrics Distribution]{%
\textbf{Distribution of quality control metrics across ONT sequencing experiments.}
\textbf{(A)}~Histogram of mean Q-scores showing a bimodal distribution with median quality of 14.0 (dashed line), ranging from 2.9 to 26.4 across 150 experiments with available quality data.
\textbf{(B)}~N50 read length distribution demonstrating predominantly short-read experiments (median: 4,828~bp) consistent with plasmid sequencing applications, with outliers representing whole-genome sequencing experiments achieving N50 values up to 95,808~bp.
\textbf{(C)}~Scatter plot of mean Q-score versus N50 read length, colored by sample category. Human samples (green) show characteristically higher N50 values, while plasmid samples (blue) cluster at shorter read lengths with variable quality scores.
