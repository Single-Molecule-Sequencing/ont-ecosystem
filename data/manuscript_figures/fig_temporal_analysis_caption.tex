\textbf{Temporal analysis of Oxford Nanopore sequencing experiments (n=148 with date information).}
\textbf{(A)}~Cumulative experiment count showing exponential growth beginning in early 2025, with the registry expanding from approximately 15 experiments in 2024 to 148 by late 2025.
\textbf{(B)}~Monthly distribution of experiments demonstrating peak activity in July--August 2025 (>25 experiments/month), reflecting increased laboratory throughput and adoption.
\textbf{(C)}~Chemistry adoption over time showing complete transition to R10.4.1 chemistry by 2025, with legacy R10.4 experiments primarily from 2021--2022.
\textbf{(D)}~Temporal distribution of sample categories revealing initial focus on research applications (2020--2024), followed by a surge in plasmid sequencing (mid-2025) and emergence of pharmacogenomics studies (September 2025).
