Registry Overview and Composition

We constructed a comprehensive registry of 165 Oxford Nanopore sequencing experiments with standardized metadata and quality metrics. After validation and enrichment, 100% of experiments achieved "good" completeness status (score ≥8), with one experiment excluded as invalid (placeholder entry with no associated data).

The registry encompasses experiments from two primary sources: local institutional sequencing (n=144, 87.3%) and publicly available ONT Open Data (n=21, 12.7%). Temporal coverage spans from August 2020 to December 2025, with 148 experiments (89.7%) containing validated run date information.

Sample Categories and Applications

Experiments were classified into nine distinct sample categories based on biological source and experimental purpose. Plasmid sequencing represented the dominant application (n=80, 48.5%), reflecting the utility of long-read sequencing for construct verification and plasmid assembly. Research projects comprised the second largest category (n=39, 23.6%), followed by human genomics (n=16, 9.7%) and pharmacogenomics studies (n=13, 7.9%).

Specialized applications included microbial sequencing (n=5, 3.0%), multiplexed experiments (n=4, 2.4%), CRISPR-related studies (n=3, 1.8%), cancer research (n=2, 1.2%), and general laboratory runs (n=3, 1.8%). The pharmacogenomics category notably included 13 experiments with clinical sample identifiers (14309-CZ, 14400-CZ, 14507-CZ series), representing targeted sequencing of cytochrome P450 genes using the PGx panel.

Technical Platform Distribution

Sequencing Devices
The registry captures experiments across the full spectrum of ONT sequencing platforms. MinION Mk1D devices dominated the registry (n=81, 49.1%), serving as the primary workhorse for routine plasmid and research applications. Standard MinION devices contributed 36 experiments (21.8%), while PromethION high-throughput sequencers accounted for 29 experiments (17.6%).

The P2 Solo platform (n=9, 5.5%) was exclusively associated with pharmacogenomics applications, reflecting its deployment for clinical sequencing workflows. Flongle flow cells (n=4, 2.4%) were utilized for rapid, low-input applications including microbial identification.

Chemistry and Basecalling
Near-universal adoption of R10.4.1 chemistry was observed (n=157, 95.2%), with legacy R10.4 chemistry present in only 8 experiments (4.8%), primarily from 2021-2022. This distribution reflects the rapid transition to improved pore chemistry following its commercial release.

Dorado basecaller dominated the registry (n=136, 82.4%), consistent with its designation as the successor to guppy following ONT's September 2022 announcement. Legacy guppy-basecalled experiments comprised 8.5% of the registry (n=14).

Basecalling Model Selection
High-accuracy (hac) models were employed in 89.7% of experiments (n=148), representing the standard balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Super-accuracy (sup) models were used in 12 experiments (7.3%), predominantly on PromethION platforms for human genomics and pharmacogenomics applications where variant calling accuracy is paramount.

Fast models were limited to 5 experiments (3.0%), primarily on MinION Mk1D and Flongle devices for applications prioritizing rapid turnaround over maximum accuracy.

Quality Control Metrics

Quality metrics were available for 150 experiments (90.9%), enabling comprehensive characterization of sequencing performance across the registry.

Base Quality Distribution
Mean Q-scores ranged from 2.9 to 26.4, with a median of 14.0. The distribution exhibited slight bimodality, with the primary peak at Q12-Q15 representing typical nanopore sequencing quality and a secondary population at Q18-Q22 corresponding to experiments with optimized library preparation or super-accuracy basecalling.

Read Length Characteristics
N50 values demonstrated substantial variation (range: 110-95,808 bp; median: 4,828 bp), reflecting the diverse applications within the registry. The distribution was right-skewed, with the majority of experiments clustering below 10,000 bp N50, consistent with the predominance of plasmid sequencing applications.

Outliers with N50 >50,000 bp corresponded to whole-genome sequencing experiments, particularly human samples where ultra-long read protocols were employed.

Sequencing Yield
Total read counts varied over six orders of magnitude (range: 1-45,136,865; median: 320,738), reflecting the spectrum from targeted amplicon sequencing to high-depth whole-genome applications.

Temporal Trends

Analysis of 148 dated experiments revealed distinct temporal patterns in registry composition and technology adoption.

Registry Growth
Cumulative experiment count demonstrated exponential growth beginning in early 2025, with the registry expanding from approximately 15 experiments through 2024 to 148 by December 2025. Monthly experiment rates peaked at 28 experiments in July 2025.

Technology Transitions
The temporal analysis captured the complete transition from R10.4 to R10.4.1 chemistry. R10.4 experiments were concentrated in 2021-2022, with R10.4.1 achieving complete dominance by January 2025. Similarly, the dorado basecaller transition from guppy was reflected in post-2022 experiments universally utilizing dorado.

Application Evolution
Sample category distribution evolved over the registry timeframe. Early experiments (2020-2024) were predominantly research-focused, with plasmid sequencing emerging as the dominant application in mid-2025. Pharmacogenomics studies appeared in September 2025, representing the newest application category.

Registry Completeness

Following automated enrichment and deep scrutiny validation, all 165 valid experiments achieved "good" completeness status. Field-level completeness exceeded 95% for critical metadata including chemistry (97.6%), basecall model (97.6%), and flow cell type (94.6%). Sample information was present for 90.4% of experiments, with quality metrics available for 90.9%.

Fifteen experiments (9.1%) were flagged as requiring HPC access for complete QC metric computation, as their source data resides on institutional high-performance computing infrastructure not accessible during registry construction.
