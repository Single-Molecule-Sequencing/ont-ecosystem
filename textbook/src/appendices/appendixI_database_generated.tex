\section*{Overview}

This appendix provides comprehensive chapter-by-chapter mathematical references automatically generated from the equation and variable database system. Each chapter section includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Complete list of all equations introduced in that chapter with full LaTeX, descriptions, physical interpretations, and assumptions
\item Summary table of all variables defined or used in the chapter with units, domains, and typical ranges
\item Cross-references to related equations and variables
\item Examples demonstrating practical usage
\end{itemize}

This database-driven approach ensures consistency across the textbook and enables systematic updates as the mathematical framework evolves. All content is generated from the authoritative \texttt{equations.yaml} and \texttt{variables.yaml} databases (see repository root).

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Database Statistics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Total equations: 87 across 11 chapters
\item Total variables: 67 with comprehensive specifications
\item Equation families: 9 interconnected groups identified
\item Hub variables: 30+ variables used in multiple equations
\item Data consistency: 100\% validated
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Using This Appendix:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Navigate to your chapter of interest
\item Review variable summary table for quick reference
\item See detailed equation boxes for complete mathematical specifications
\item Follow cross-references to related material
\item Use equation labels (e.g., \texttt{eq:posterior-bayes}) for citations
\end{itemize}
