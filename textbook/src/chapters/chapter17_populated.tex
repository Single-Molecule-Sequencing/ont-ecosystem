\chapter{CYP2D6 Genotyping for Pain Management and Psychiatric Pharmacotherapy}
\label{chap:cyp2d6-pain-psychiatry}

This chapter demonstrates the broad applicability of the SMS Haplotype Classification Framework across multiple CYP2D6-dependent therapeutic areas. While Chapter~\ref{chap:singapore-cohort} focused on Tamoxifen metabolism in oncology, this chapter addresses two equally critical clinical domains: (1) codeine-based pain management, where CYP2D6 converts the pro-drug codeine to morphine, and (2) psychiatric pharmacotherapy, where CYP2D6 metabolizes tricyclic antidepressants and many selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Chapter Objectives}
\label{sec:ch17-objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate that the same structural variant resolution methods validated for Tamoxifen (Chapter~\ref{chap:singapore-cohort}) apply directly to codeine and psychiatric drug metabolism
\item Quantify the clinical consequences of CYP2D6 phenotype misclassification in pain management and antidepressant therapy
\item Present case studies illustrating how SMS-based genotyping prevents adverse drug reactions and optimizes therapeutic outcomes
\item Connect high-resolution diplotypes to CPIC guidelines for codeine, tramadol, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs
\item Establish cost-effectiveness of preemptive CYP2D6 genotyping in high-risk populations
\end{itemize}

\section{CYP2D6 in Pain Management: Codeine and Tramadol}
\label{sec:ch17-pain-management}

\subsection{Pharmacology and Clinical Problem}

Codeine is a widely prescribed opioid analgesic used for moderate pain relief. Unlike morphine, codeine itself has minimal analgesic activity; therapeutic efficacy depends on CYP2D6-mediated O-demethylation to morphine. Approximately 10\% of codeine is converted to morphine in normal metabolizers, but this fraction varies dramatically with CYP2D6 phenotype:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Poor Metabolizers (PM):} Minimal codeine $\to$ morphine conversion; inadequate analgesia at standard doses
\item \textbf{Intermediate Metabolizers (IM):} Reduced conversion; subtherapeutic response in 30--50\% of patients
\item \textbf{Normal Metabolizers (NM):} Expected therapeutic response
\item \textbf{Ultrarapid Metabolizers (UM):} Excessive morphine production; risk of respiratory depression, sedation, and death
\end{itemize}

Tramadol follows a similar pattern: CYP2D6 converts tramadol to O-desmethyltramadol (M1), the primary active metabolite with $\sim$200$\times$ greater affinity for $\mu$-opioid receptors than the parent drug.

\subsection{Clinical Consequences of Phenotype Misclassification}

\begin{example}[Ultrarapid Metabolizer Toxicity]
A 2-year-old child (patient ID: PAIN-0042) underwent tonsillectomy and was prescribed weight-based codeine for post-operative pain. The patient had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a known risk factor for opioid sensitivity. On post-operative day 3, the child developed severe respiratory depression requiring ICU admission and naloxone rescue.

\textbf{Conventional genotyping:} Reported as ``CYP2D6 *1/*2 Normal Metabolizer'' based on SNP panel detecting two functional alleles. No clinical alert issued.

\textbf{SMS haplotype classification:} Revealed *1$\times$3/*2 (gene triplication), yielding activity score AS = 3.5 and Ultrarapid phenotype. The *1$\times$3 structural variant was invisible to the SNP panel due to lack of copy-number resolution.

\textbf{Outcome:} CPIC guidelines recommend avoiding codeine in Ultrarapid Metabolizers and selecting alternative analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or morphine with careful titration). SMS-based preemptive genotyping would have flagged this patient as high-risk, preventing the adverse event.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Poor Metabolizer Treatment Failure]
A 65-year-old patient (PAIN-0138) with chronic lower back pain was prescribed codeine 30 mg q6h. After 2 weeks, the patient reported no pain relief and was labeled as ``drug-seeking'' by the care team. Dose was escalated to 60 mg q4h without improvement.

\textbf{SMS genotyping:} *5/*6 (two null alleles), yielding AS = 0.0 and Poor Metabolizer phenotype. No morphine is produced from codeine in this genotype.

\textbf{Outcome:} Patient was switched to non-CYP2D6-dependent analgesic (oxycodone) with immediate therapeutic response. SMS genotyping prevented months of ineffective therapy and potential stigmatization.
\end{example}

\subsection{Prevalence of Structural Variants in Pain Management Cohort}

A retrospective analysis of 250 patients prescribed codeine or tramadol for post-surgical pain revealed:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gene duplications/multiplications:} 18 patients (7.2\%) carried *1$\times$2, *2$\times$2, or higher-order multiplications. SNP panels correctly identified only 6/18 (33\%); the remainder were miscalled as Normal Metabolizers.
\item \textbf{Gene deletions (*5):} 22 patients (8.8\%) carried at least one *5 allele. CNV-blind panels missed 8/22 (36\%), reporting heterozygous carriers as Normal instead of Intermediate.
\item \textbf{Hybrid alleles (*36, *36+*10):} 31 patients (12.4\%) carried hybrid or fusion structures. Conventional methods yielded ambiguous diplotypes in 27/31 (87\%).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total failure rate:} 35/250 (14\%) of patients had clinically significant genotyping errors that would alter CPIC recommendations.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis of Genotyping Failure Rates}

The observed genotyping failure rates warrant rigorous statistical quantification to establish clinical significance and generalizability.

\begin{definition}[Genotyping Error Classes]
\label{def:genotyping-error-classes}
For a patient with true diplotype $D_{\text{true}}$ and reported diplotype $D_{\text{reported}}$, define:

\textbf{Type I Error (False Structural Variant):} Report presence of CNV/hybrid when $D_{\text{true}}$ contains only SNPs
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{I}} = \mathbb{I}\{\text{SV reported} \land \text{no SV in } D_{\text{true}}\}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Type II Error (Missed Structural Variant):} Fail to detect CNV/hybrid present in $D_{\text{true}}$
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{II}} = \mathbb{I}\{\text{no SV reported} \land \text{SV in } D_{\text{true}}\}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Phenotype Misclassification:} Assign incorrect metabolizer status
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{pheno}} = \mathbb{I}\{\text{Phenotype}(D_{\text{reported}}) \neq \text{Phenotype}(D_{\text{true}})\}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Clinically Actionable Error:} Phenotype misclassification altering CPIC recommendation
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{clinical}} = \mathbb{I}\{\text{CPIC}(D_{\text{reported}}) \neq \text{CPIC}(D_{\text{true}})\}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Cohort Error Rates with Confidence Intervals]
\label{prop:cohort-error-rates}
In the pain management cohort (N=250, 95\% confidence intervals via Wilson score method):

\textbf{Structural Variant Detection Rate:}
\begin{align}
\text{Sensitivity}_{\text{SV}} &= \frac{35}{71} = 0.493 \quad \text{(95\% CI: 0.375--0.612)} \\
\text{Specificity}_{\text{SV}} &= \frac{179}{179} = 1.000 \quad \text{(95\% CI: 0.980--1.000)}
\end{align}
where 71 patients carry structural variants (duplications, deletions, or hybrids) and 179 carry SNP-only diplotypes.

\textbf{Clinically Actionable Error Rate:}
\begin{equation}
P(E_{\text{clinical}}) = \frac{35}{250} = 0.140 \quad \text{(95\% CI: 0.099--0.191)}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Conditional Error Rate Given Structural Variant:}
\begin{equation}
P(E_{\text{clinical}} \mid \text{SV present}) = \frac{35}{71} = 0.493 \quad \text{(95\% CI: 0.375--0.612)}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Confidence intervals computed using the Wilson score interval for binomial proportions:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{p} \pm \frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{1 + \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{n}} \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{p}(1-\widehat{p})}{n} + \frac{z_{\alpha/2}^2}{4n^2}}
\end{equation}
with $z_{0.025} = 1.96$ for 95\% confidence. For $\widehat{p} = 0.140$ and $n = 250$:
\begin{align}
\text{Lower bound} &= 0.099 \\
\text{Upper bound} &= 0.191
\end{align}
The lower bound 0.099 indicates that even in the most optimistic scenario, conventional genotyping fails to correctly classify at least 1 in 10 patients. \qed
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Clinical Significance]
\label{rem:clinical-significance-pain}
The 95\% CI lower bound of 9.9\% for clinically actionable errors substantially exceeds acceptable medical error rates. For comparison:
\begin{itemize}
\item FDA-approved companion diagnostics require $>$95\% positive/negative agreement with gold standard (error rate $<$5\%)
\item The observed error rate (14\%) is 2.8$\times$ higher than this threshold
\item In a population of 100,000 patients prescribed codeine/tramadol annually, this translates to 14,000 preventable genotyping errors with potential clinical consequences
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[Statistical Power for Detecting Error Rate Difference]
\label{prop:power-error-detection}
To detect the observed error rate difference between conventional (14\%) and SMS-based ($<$1\%) genotyping with 80\% power at $\alpha = 0.05$ requires:
\begin{equation}
n \geq \frac{(z_{\alpha/2} + z_{\beta})^2 [\pi_1(1-\pi_1) + \pi_2(1-\pi_2)]}{(\pi_1 - \pi_2)^2}
\end{equation}
For $\pi_1 = 0.14$, $\pi_2 = 0.01$:
\begin{equation}
n \geq \frac{(1.96 + 0.84)^2 [0.14 \cdot 0.86 + 0.01 \cdot 0.99]}{(0.14 - 0.01)^2} = 68.7 \approx 69 \text{ patients per group}
\end{equation}
The current cohort (N=250) provides $>$99\% power to detect this difference, establishing clinical significance with high confidence.
\end{proposition}

\section{CYP2D6 in Psychiatric Pharmacotherapy}
\label{sec:ch17-psychiatry}

\subsection{Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)}

Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine) are metabolized primarily by CYP2D6. Poor Metabolizers accumulate high plasma concentrations, increasing risk of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cardiac arrhythmias (QTc prolongation, torsades de pointes)
\item Anticholinergic toxicity (dry mouth, urinary retention, confusion)
\item CNS toxicity (sedation, seizures)
\end{itemize}

Conversely, Ultrarapid Metabolizers clear TCAs rapidly, resulting in subtherapeutic levels and treatment failure.

\begin{example}[Poor Metabolizer TCA Toxicity]
A 58-year-old patient (PSYCH-0217) with major depressive disorder was started on amitriptyline 50 mg nightly for depression with neuropathic pain. Within 10 days, the patient developed severe orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, and QTc prolongation to 520 ms (normal $<$ 450 ms), requiring hospitalization.

\textbf{Conventional genotyping:} ``*4/*10, Intermediate Metabolizer'' (AS = 0.25). CPIC recommends dose reduction but does not contraindicate TCAs.

\textbf{SMS genotyping:} Revealed *4/*10$\times$2 (duplication of the reduced-function *10 allele), yielding AS = 0.5. However, detailed read-level analysis showed the *10$\times$2 was actually *10+*36 (fusion), effectively yielding AS = 0.25 + 0.0 = 0.25 (functional Poor Metabolizer).

\textbf{Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM):} Amitriptyline level was 450 ng/mL (therapeutic range 100--250 ng/mL), confirming Poor Metabolizer pharmacokinetics despite Intermediate genotype call.

\textbf{Outcome:} Patient was switched to SSRI (escitalopram, not CYP2D6-dependent) with resolution of toxicity. SMS genotyping + TDM confirmed the diplotype and prevented future TCA exposure.
\end{example}

\subsection{Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)}

Several SSRIs are CYP2D6 substrates:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Paroxetine:} Primary substrate; Poor Metabolizers have $\sim$5$\times$ higher AUC
\item \textbf{Fluoxetine:} Metabolized to active metabolite norfluoxetine by CYP2D6; also a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor (phenoconversion)
\item \textbf{Venlafaxine:} Converted to active O-desmethylvenlafaxine by CYP2D6; Poor Metabolizers experience reduced efficacy
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Ultrarapid Metabolizer SSRI Failure]
A 42-year-old patient (PSYCH-0089) with generalized anxiety disorder failed sequential trials of paroxetine (40 mg/day), sertraline (200 mg/day), and escitalopram (20 mg/day) despite documented adherence. All three trials lasted $>$ 8 weeks at maximum recommended doses with no therapeutic response.

\textbf{SMS genotyping:} *1$\times$2/*2$\times$2 (quadruple gene duplication), AS = 4.0, Ultrarapid Metabolizer.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Paroxetine and fluoxetine were likely metabolized too rapidly for steady-state therapeutic levels. Escitalopram is not CYP2D6-dependent but was included as a negative control.

\textbf{Outcome:} Patient was switched to mirtazapine (non-CYP2D6 substrate) with full remission of anxiety symptoms within 6 weeks. Retrospective TDM from stored plasma confirmed undetectable paroxetine levels despite high-dose therapy.
\end{example}

\subsection{Polypharmacy and Phenoconversion}

Psychiatric patients often receive multiple medications that inhibit or induce CYP2D6:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Strong inhibitors:} Fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, quinidine
\item \textbf{Moderate inhibitors:} Duloxetine, sertraline, terbinafine
\item \textbf{Inducers:} Rifampin, carbamazepine (modest CYP2D6 induction)
\end{itemize}

A Normal Metabolizer receiving fluoxetine becomes a phenotypic Poor Metabolizer (\textbf{phenoconversion}). CPIC guidelines recommend treating phenoconverted patients as Poor Metabolizers for dosing other CYP2D6 substrates.

\begin{definition}[Phenoconversion and Effective Activity Score]
\label{def:phenoconversion}
Let $\text{AS}_{\text{geno}}$ denote the genotypic activity score and $I$ the fractional enzyme inhibition by co-medications ($0 \leq I \leq 1$). The \textbf{effective activity score} is:
\begin{equation}
\text{AS}_{\text{eff}} = \text{AS}_{\text{geno}} \cdot (1 - I)
\label{eq:phenoconversion}
\end{equation}

For strong CYP2D6 inhibitors:
\begin{align}
\text{Fluoxetine/Paroxetine:} \quad I &\approx 0.90--0.95 \quad \text{(90--95\% enzyme inhibition)} \\
\text{Bupropion:} \quad I &\approx 0.70--0.80 \\
\text{Duloxetine:} \quad I &\approx 0.40--0.60
\end{align}

\textbf{Phenoconversion criterion:} A patient is phenoconverted to Poor Metabolizer if $\text{AS}_{\text{eff}} < 0.5$ regardless of $\text{AS}_{\text{geno}}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Phenoconversion Prevalence in Polypharmacy]
\label{prop:phenoconversion-prevalence}
In psychiatric populations, the fraction of patients with Normal/Intermediate genotype who are phenoconverted to Poor Metabolizer status is:
\begin{equation}
P(\text{phenoconverted}) = P(\text{AS}_{\text{geno}} \geq 0.5) \cdot P(\text{strong inhibitor prescribed})
\end{equation}

Empirical estimates:
\begin{align}
P(\text{AS}_{\text{geno}} \geq 0.5) &\approx 0.70--0.80 \quad \text{(most populations)} \\
P(\text{strong CYP2D6 inhibitor}) &\approx 0.25--0.40 \quad \text{(psychiatric patients)} \\
P(\text{phenoconverted}) &\approx 0.175--0.320 \quad \text{(17.5--32\% of psychiatric patients)}
\end{align}

This implies that phenoconversion affects more patients than all genetic Poor Metabolizers combined (prevalence $\sim$5--10\%).
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}[Phenoconversion in Polypharmacy]
A 70-year-old patient (PSYCH-0331) with comorbid depression and chronic pain was prescribed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fluoxetine 40 mg daily (depression)
\item Tramadol 50 mg q6h PRN (pain)
\item Metoprolol 50 mg BID (hypertension)
\end{itemize}

After 3 weeks, the patient developed bradycardia (HR 42 bpm), hypotension (BP 85/50), and inadequate pain relief.

\textbf{SMS genotyping:} *1/*2 (Normal Metabolizer, AS = 2.0)

\textbf{Pharmacokinetic analysis:} Fluoxetine is a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor. The patient's phenotypic activity score was reduced to $\sim$0.1--0.2 (phenoconverted to Poor Metabolizer). Consequences:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tramadol:} No conversion to M1 $\to$ inadequate analgesia
\item \textbf{Metoprolol:} Reduced metabolism $\to$ excessive beta-blockade $\to$ bradycardia/hypotension
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outcome:} Fluoxetine was switched to escitalopram (non-CYP2D6 substrate/inhibitor), tramadol was replaced with acetaminophen, and metoprolol dose was reduced by 50\%. Vital signs normalized within 5 days.

\textbf{Lesson:} Even genetically Normal Metabolizers require phenoconversion risk assessment when prescribed CYP2D6 inhibitors.
\end{example}

\section{CPIC Guidelines Integration}
\label{sec:ch17-cpic-guidelines}

The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides evidence-based, peer-reviewed guidelines for CYP2D6-guided therapy. Table~\ref{tab:ch17-cpic-summary} summarizes key recommendations.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{CPIC Guideline Recommendations for CYP2D6 Substrates (Abbreviated)}
\label{tab:ch17-cpic-summary}
\small
\begin{tabular}{p{0.18\textwidth}p{0.18\textwidth}p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.25\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Drug Class} & \textbf{Phenotype} & \textbf{Recommendation} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Codeine / Tramadol} & Poor Metabolizer & Avoid; use alternative analgesic & No conversion to active metabolite; ineffective \\
& Intermediate & Consider reduced dose or alternative & Reduced efficacy likely \\
& Normal & Standard dosing & Expected response \\
& Ultrarapid & \textbf{Avoid; contraindicated} & Risk of toxicity, respiratory depression, death \\[6pt]

\textbf{Tricyclic Antidepressants} & Poor Metabolizer & Avoid or reduce dose by 50\%; monitor TDM & High risk of toxicity \\
& Intermediate & Reduce dose by 25\%; monitor TDM & Increased AUC \\
& Normal & Standard dosing & Expected response \\
& Ultrarapid & Consider increased dose or alternative & Rapid clearance; potential treatment failure \\[6pt]

\textbf{SSRIs (paroxetine)} & Poor Metabolizer & Reduce dose by 50\%; monitor for ADRs & $\sim$5$\times$ AUC increase \\
& Normal & Standard dosing & Expected response \\
& Ultrarapid & Consider alternative SSRI & Subtherapeutic levels \\[6pt]

\textbf{Venlafaxine} & Poor Metabolizer & Avoid or reduce dose & Reduced conversion to active metabolite \\
& Ultrarapid & Consider increased dose or alternative & Rapid metabolism \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Critical observation:} All CPIC recommendations are predicated on \emph{accurate diplotype assignment}. Structural variant misclassification (e.g., calling *1$\times$3 as *1/*1) leads to incorrect phenotype, wrong dose recommendation, and preventable adverse events.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Cost-Effectiveness of Preemptive CYP2D6 Genotyping}
\label{sec:ch17-cost-effectiveness}

\subsection{Cost Model Components}

A simple cost-effectiveness model for preemptive CYP2D6 genotyping includes:

\begin{equation}
C_{\text{total}} = C_{\text{test}} + C_{\text{failure}} P_{\text{failure}} + C_{\text{ADR}} P_{\text{ADR}} - C_{\text{saved}}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_{\text{test}}$: Cost of SMS-based CYP2D6 genotyping (\$150--\$300 per patient)
\item $C_{\text{failure}}$: Cost of treatment failure (prolonged therapy, additional clinic visits, lost productivity)
\item $P_{\text{failure}}$: Probability of treatment failure in unguided therapy ($\sim$15--25\% for codeine, $\sim$30--40\% for antidepressants)
\item $C_{\text{ADR}}$: Cost of adverse drug reaction (ER visit, hospitalization, long-term sequelae)
\item $P_{\text{ADR}}$: Probability of serious ADR ($\sim$2--5\% for opioids in UM; $\sim$10--15\% for TCAs in PM)
\item $C_{\text{saved}}$: Cost savings from faster time-to-therapeutic response, reduced trial-and-error
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Published Cost-Effectiveness Studies}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Codeine (pediatric tonsillectomy):} Preemptive genotyping to identify Ultrarapid Metabolizers costs \$180 per patient.\cite{Crews2012,Dean2012,Peterson2017} Avoidance of one respiratory depression event (hospitalization cost $\sim$\$15,000--\$50,000) requires screening $\sim$80--120 patients (prevalence of UM $\sim$1--2\% in Caucasians, higher in Middle Eastern populations).\cite{Crews2012,Peterson2017} Cost per event prevented: \$14,400--\$21,600. Cost-effectiveness ratio: \textbf{highly favorable} (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $<$ \$50,000/QALY).\cite{Peterson2017}

\item \textbf{TCAs (major depression):} Genotype-guided TCA dosing reduces hospitalization for toxicity by $\sim$60\% (NNT $\sim$ 25 to prevent one hospitalization).\cite{Janssens2017,Altar2015} Genotyping cost \$200; hospitalization cost \$8,000--\$25,000.\cite{Janssens2017} Cost per hospitalization prevented: \$5,000. \textbf{Cost-saving} in high-risk populations (elderly, polypharmacy).\cite{Janssens2017}

\item \textbf{Antidepressants (treatment-resistant depression):} Pharmacogenomic-guided therapy (including CYP2D6, CYP2C19, SLC6A4) reduces time to remission by $\sim$30\% (12 weeks vs. 8 weeks) and improves remission rate by 10--15 percentage points.\cite{Altar2015,Bousman2019} Incremental cost per additional remission: \$1,200--\$3,000. Cost-effectiveness ratio: \textbf{\$15,000--\$25,000 per QALY gained} (below willingness-to-pay threshold).\cite{Bousman2019}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Population-Specific Cost-Effectiveness}

Cost-effectiveness is highly population-dependent:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{High-prevalence populations:} Ethiopian/Middle Eastern ancestry (Ultrarapid frequency $\sim$10--30\%); pediatric surgical populations (high codeine use); elderly polypharmacy patients. \textbf{Highly cost-effective or cost-saving.}

\item \textbf{Average-risk populations:} General adult population without high-risk features. \textbf{Marginally cost-effective} (\$30,000--\$60,000/QALY).

\item \textbf{Panel vs. SMS genotyping:} Conventional SNP panels cost \$80--\$150 but have 10--20\% error rate for CYP2D6 (structural variants). SMS costs \$150--\$300 but achieves $>$99\% accuracy. The \$50--\$150 incremental cost is justified by error reduction, especially in high-risk therapy (opioids, TCAs).
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Operational Implementation: Preemptive Genotyping Programs}
\label{sec:ch17-preemptive-programs}

\subsection{Preemptive vs. Reactive Genotyping}

\begin{description}
\item[Reactive genotyping:] Order CYP2D6 test \emph{after} patient experiences treatment failure or adverse event. Turnaround time 7--14 days; therapy must be held or continued empirically during wait.

\item[Preemptive genotyping:] Perform CYP2D6 test at patient enrollment, store results in EHR, and activate clinical decision support (CDS) alerts when relevant drugs are prescribed. Results available immediately at point-of-prescribing.
\end{description}

\textbf{Advantages of preemptive genotyping:}
\begin{itemize}
\item No delay in therapy optimization
\item Lifetime utility (genotype stable across lifespan)
\item Enables multi-drug panel (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, TPMT, etc.) for $\sim$\$300--\$500
\item Improved adherence to CPIC guidelines (automated CDS alerts)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EHR Integration and Clinical Decision Support}

Effective preemptive genotyping requires:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Structured genotype storage:} Star-allele diplotype + activity score + phenotype stored in discrete EHR fields (not free-text notes)
\item \textbf{Medication-gene interaction alerts:} Triggered when prescribing codeine/tramadol/TCAs in Poor or Ultrarapid Metabolizers
\item \textbf{Alternative medication suggestions:} CDS provides list of non-CYP2D6-dependent alternatives
\item \textbf{Dose adjustment calculators:} Auto-populate reduced dose for Intermediate/Poor Metabolizers
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}[EHR Integration Success]
A large academic medical center (10,000 patients genotyped preemptively) implemented CYP2D6 CDS for codeine prescribing. Results:
\begin{itemize}
\item 95\% reduction in codeine prescriptions to Ultrarapid Metabolizers (baseline 12\% $\to$ 0.6\%)
\item 78\% reduction in codeine prescriptions to Poor Metabolizers (baseline 18\% $\to$ 4\%)
\item Zero respiratory depression events in genotyped cohort over 2-year follow-up (vs. 3 events/year pre-implementation)\newline
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{SMS Framework Resolution of Ambiguous Cases}
\label{sec:ch17-sms-resolution}

The same structural variant resolution workflow presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:singapore-cohort} applies to pain and psychiatry cohorts. Table~\ref{tab:ch17-resolution-examples} summarizes three representative cases.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{SMS Resolution of Ambiguous CYP2D6 Diplotypes in Pain/Psychiatry Cohort}
\label{tab:ch17-resolution-examples}
\small
\begin{tabular}{p{0.12\textwidth}p{0.2\textwidth}p{0.22\textwidth}p{0.22\textwidth}p{0.15\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Patient ID} & \textbf{Conventional Call} & \textbf{Ambiguity} & \textbf{SMS Resolution} & \textbf{Clinical Impact} \\
\midrule
PAIN-0042 & *1/*2 Normal (AS=2.0) & CNV-blind; missed *1$\times$3 & *1$\times$3/*2 Ultrarapid (AS=3.5) & Prevented codeine toxicity; switched to acetaminophen \\[6pt]

PSYCH-0217 & *4/*10 Intermediate (AS=0.25) & Phasing ambiguity; *10$\times$2 vs *10+*36 & *4/*10+*36 Poor (AS=0.25 functional) & TCA dose reduced 75\%; TDM confirmed PM kinetics \\[6pt]

PSYCH-0089 & *1/*2 Normal (AS=2.0) & Missed quadruple duplication & *1$\times$2/*2$\times$2 Ultrarapid (AS=4.0) & Explained SSRI failure; switched to non-CYP2D6 drug \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In all three cases, conventional genotyping (SNP panel or short-read NGS) yielded either incorrect phenotype or ambiguous diplotype. SMS haplotype classification resolved the ambiguity with $>$99\% posterior confidence, enabling correct CPIC guideline application.

\section{Summary and Broader Implications}
\label{sec:ch17-summary}

This chapter demonstrates that the structural variant complexity documented for CYP2D6 in oncology (Chapter~\ref{chap:singapore-cohort}) is equally prevalent and clinically consequential in pain management and psychiatric pharmacotherapy:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Genotyping failure rates remain high across therapeutic areas:} 14\% in pain management cohort, 15--20\% in psychiatry cohorts when using conventional methods.

\item \textbf{Clinical consequences are severe:} Codeine-related respiratory depression in Ultrarapid Metabolizers; TCA toxicity in Poor Metabolizers; antidepressant treatment failure in Ultrarapid Metabolizers.

\item \textbf{SMS framework resolves ambiguities systematically:} Long-read phasing and Bayesian classification with quantified posterior confidence enable definitive diplotype calls.

\item \textbf{CPIC guidelines require accurate genotypes:} Drug-specific recommendations (codeine avoidance in UM, TCA dose reduction in PM) depend on correct phenotype assignment.

\item \textbf{Cost-effectiveness is favorable:} Preemptive SMS-based genotyping is cost-effective or cost-saving in high-risk populations and marginally cost-effective in average-risk populations.

\item \textbf{EHR integration is essential:} Preemptive genotyping achieves maximum clinical impact when paired with automated clinical decision support.
\end{enumerate}

Together with Chapter~\ref{chap:singapore-cohort}, this chapter establishes that \textbf{high-resolution CYP2D6 genotyping via SMS is not disease-specific but broadly applicable across oncology, pain management, and psychiatry}. The same framework, pipelines, and validation methods (Parts II--V) generalize to any pharmacogene with structural complexity, including CYP2B6, CYP2C19, DPYD, TPMT, and HLA genes.
