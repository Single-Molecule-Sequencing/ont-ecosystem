\section{Clinical Imperative: Endoxifen Variability and Tamoxifen Failure}
\label{sec:ch18-clinical-imperative}

Tamoxifen is a pro-drug widely used as adjuvant endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. Standard 5--10 year regimens substantially reduce recurrence and mortality in large randomized controlled trials; yet approximately half of treated patients ultimately relapse despite adherence to therapy.

The pharmacologically active metabolite is (Z)-endoxifen, produced primarily by CYP2D6-mediated biotransformation of Tamoxifen through N-desmethyl-tamoxifen. Endoxifen plasma concentrations vary by roughly an order of magnitude (11--24$\times$) between individuals on identical Tamoxifen dosing regimens. Low endoxifen levels are strongly associated with metabolic resistance and increased risk of treatment failure in retrospective pharmacokinetic studies.

This creates a clinical Catch-22:
\begin{itemize}
\item CYP2D6 genotype is the dominant genetic determinant of endoxifen exposure, explaining approximately 30--50\% of inter-individual variability
\item However, decades of clinical studies using imperfect CYP2D6 assays have yielded ``inconclusive'' associations between genotype and clinical outcome, undermining confidence in genotype-guided therapy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Two Failures Blocking Tamoxifen Pharmacogenomics}
\label{sec:ch18-two-failures}

The long history of ``inconclusive'' associations between CYP2D6 genotype and Tamoxifen outcomes does not imply that CYP2D6 is unimportant. Rather, it reflects the compound effect of two distinct failures that have historically undermined pharmacogenomic studies in this setting.

\textbf{(1) The Genotyping Failure (Technical/Assay Failure).}
Most published Tamoxifen studies have relied on SNP panels, TaqMan assays, or short-read sequencing to assign CYP2D6 diplotypes. These methods are intrinsically blind to the structural complexity of the locus: whole-gene deletions (*5), copy-number variants, and CYP2D6--CYP2D7 hybrid alleles such as *36 and the tandem fusion *36+*10. When confronted with genotypes like ``*10, *36+*10, *36'', standard workflows can only enumerate a bag of possible diplotypes rather than a single phased solution. The Singapore cohort demonstrates that this is not a rare edge case: 19\% of sequenced patients (8/42) had ambiguous diplotypes and 36\% (15/42) carried a *36 hybrid or fusion allele. Ambiguous or mis-assigned genotypes inject substantial noise into any attempted genotype--outcome association, attenuating observed effect sizes and producing apparently ``negative'' studies.

\textbf{(2) The Biological Failure (Modeling Failure).}
Even if CYP2D6 were genotyped perfectly, genotype alone is an imprecise surrogate for endoxifen exposure. Meta-analytic and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that CYP2D6 genotype explains at most approximately 30--50\% of the inter-individual variance in steady-state endoxifen concentration. The remaining variance arises from secondary pharmacogenes (e.g.\ CYP2C, CYP3A, SULTs, UGTs), co-medications that cause phenoconversion, liver function, adherence, and other clinical factors. Any model that conditions solely on CYP2D6 genotype will therefore be under-specified: even with perfect genotyping, its predictive performance for endoxifen or clinical outcome will be limited.

\textbf{Implication.}
The path to clinically useful Tamoxifen pharmacogenomics is thus sequential. First, the genotyping failure must be solved by replacing structurally blind assays with long-read, haplotype-resolving methods such as the SMS Haplotype Classification Framework. Second, the biological failure must be addressed by embedding CYP2D6 diplotype within a multi-factorial pharmacokinetic model that integrates secondary genetics and clinical covariates. In this chapter, we focus on the first step: demonstrating, in the Singapore cohort, that structurally complex and ambiguous CYP2D6 genotypes can be systematically resolved using SMS with quantified posterior confidence. The Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm outlined in Section~\ref{sec:ch18-precision-algorithm} builds directly on this foundation.

The Singapore cohort is designed to break this impasse by combining:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Detailed clinical Tamoxifen treatment and outcome data from 75 breast cancer patients
\item High-resolution CYP2D6 diplotyping via the SMS Haplotype Classification Framework (Parts II--V)
\item A roadmap toward a multi-factorial Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm integrating CYP2D6 diplotype, secondary pharmacogenes, co-medication, and adherence
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Genomic Complexity: CYP2D6 as the Flagship Complex Locus}
\label{sec:ch18-genomic-complexity}

CYP2D6 resides in a structurally complex genomic region at 22q13.2 flanked by two highly homologous pseudogenes, CYP2D7 and CYP2D8, with $>95$\% sequence identity over large blocks ($>$3 kb). This architecture predisposes the locus to recurrent recombination, gene conversion, deletions, duplications, and hybrid gene formation through non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR).

\subsection{Structural Variant Classes}

Key structural variant classes include:

\begin{description}
\item[Whole-gene deletions] (e.g., *5): Complete deletion of CYP2D6, yielding a null allele with zero enzymatic activity. Deletion boundaries typically span from REP6 to REP7 repeat elements.

\item[Gene duplications and multiplications] (e.g., *1$\times$2, *2$\times$2, *10$\times$2): Tandem duplication of CYP2D6 due to unequal crossing-over. Diplotypes carrying duplications may have 2--4 total gene copies. Activity score calculation depends critically on which allele is duplicated.

\item[Hybrid genes] (e.g., *36): CYP2D6--CYP2D7 fusion alleles where a recombination breakpoint within the gene creates a chimeric sequence. The *36 allele consists of CYP2D6 exon 1 fused to CYP2D7 exons 2--9 and is enzymatically inactive.

\item[Tandem hybrid-functional fusions] (e.g., *36+*10): A tandem arrangement where a hybrid gene (*36) is followed by a functional CYP2D6 allele (*10) on the same chromosome. This complex structure arises from sequential recombination events and cannot be resolved by short-read sequencing or SNP arrays.
\end{description}

\subsection{Failure Modes of Conventional Genotyping}

For short-read sequencing (Illumina), TaqMan allele discrimination assays, and array-based methods, this complexity induces three primary failure modes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Alignment ambiguity}: 150 bp paired-end reads cannot be uniquely assigned amongst CYP2D6, CYP2D7, and CYP2D8. Standard aligners either discard multi-mapping reads (loss of information) or arbitrarily assign them (introduction of artifacts).

\item \textbf{Phasing ambiguity}: Even when individual SNPs and small indels are detected, their cis/trans phase relationships cannot be determined from short reads that do not span multiple variant sites. This yields ambiguous diplotype sets rather than definitive calls.

\item \textbf{Structural variant blindness}: SNP-based panels interrogate only single-nucleotide polymorphisms and small indels. Copy number variations, gene deletions, and hybrid alleles are invisible to these assays unless specialized CNV-calling algorithms or supplementary MLPA/qPCR assays are employed.
\end{enumerate}

In the SMS textbook, CYP2D6 is therefore treated as the \emph{flagship complex locus} for clinical haplotype classification---the paradigmatic example where single-molecule sequencing is not merely advantageous but \emph{necessary} for defensible genotyping.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Cohort Design and Data}
\label{sec:ch18-cohort-design}

The Singapore Project comprises 75 unique breast cancer patients (patient IDs 1001--1075) treated with Tamoxifen at participating oncology centers. For 42 patients, single-molecule sequencing data and pharmacogenomic interpretation are available; the remaining 33 have manifest entries with zero PharmVar activity scores and no sequence data (likely controls or patients excluded due to insufficient DNA quality).

\subsection{Data Elements}

For each of the 42 sequenced patients, the dataset includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{PharmVar diplotype}: Star allele nomenclature, potentially ambiguous for complex structural genotypes (e.g., ``*10, *36+*10, *36'' indicates presence of these three alleles but not their phase)
\item \textbf{Haplotype-level decomposition}: When resolvable, Haplotype 1 and Haplotype 2 designations specifying maternal and paternal contributions
\item \textbf{PharmVar activity score (AS)}: Sum of per-allele activity values, ranging from 0.0 (null) to 2.5+ (gene multiplication)
\item \textbf{Generic phenotype}: PharmVar classification (Poor, Intermediate, Normal, Ultrarapid Metabolizer)
\item \textbf{CPIC Tamoxifen-specific phenotype}: Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium drug-specific interpretation
\end{itemize}

This chapter uses these data as a real-world validation of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The prevalence of structurally complex CYP2D6 genotypes in an Asian clinical cohort
\item The failure modes of conventional genotyping and the frequency of ambiguous diplotype calls
\item The resolving power of the SMS Haplotype Classification Framework for structural variant phasing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cohort Demographics and Clinical Characteristics}

Table~\ref{tab:ch18-demographics} summarizes the demographics and clinical characteristics of the 42 sequenced patients.

\textbf{Key observations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The cohort is representative of Southeast Asian breast cancer populations, with predominant Chinese ethnicity.
\item Approximately one-quarter of patients were receiving concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors (phenoconversion risk).
\item All four patients with documented recurrence had Intermediate or Poor Metabolizer phenotypes, consistent with low endoxifen exposure hypothesis (though sample size precludes statistical significance testing).
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Structural Variant Landscape in the 42-Patient Cohort}
\label{sec:ch18-sv-landscape}

The sequenced subset is dominated by complex structural variants, confirming that CYP2D6 complexity is not a theoretical edge case but a routine clinical reality.

\subsection{Gene Deletions}

The *5 deletion allele (complete gene deletion) is observed in patients 1015, 1018, and 1036 (N=3). Homozygous *5/*5 individuals are null metabolizers with zero CYP2D6 activity and predictably low endoxifen levels.

\subsection{Gene Duplications and Copy Number Variations}

Copy number variations (CNVs) with tandem duplications are frequent:
\begin{itemize}
\item *1$\times$2 (duplication of *1, a normal-function allele): patient 1002
\item *2$\times$2 (duplication of *2, a normal-function allele): patients 1025, 1040
\item *5$\times$2 (duplication of the *5 deletion, yielding zero copies on that chromosome): patient 1002 (heterozygous)
\item *10$\times$2 (duplication of *10, a decreased-function allele): patients 1017, 1031, 1034
\end{itemize}

Activity score calculation depends critically on identifying \emph{which} allele is duplicated. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item *1$\times$2/*10 (AS = 2.25): duplication of high-activity *1 yields Ultrarapid phenotype
\item *10$\times$2/*10 (AS = 0.5): duplication of low-activity *10 yields Intermediate phenotype
\end{itemize}

Conventional genotyping that detects ``two copies of CYP2D6'' without allele-specific resolution cannot distinguish these scenarios.

\subsection{Hybrid Alleles and Tandem Fusions}

The most striking observation is the \textbf{high frequency of *36+*10 fusions}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15 of 42 sequenced patients carry diplotypes involving *36+*10 (e.g., *10/*36+*10, *1/*36+*10, *5$\times$2/*36+*10)
\item This corresponds to $\sim$36\% of the cohort
\end{itemize}

This demonstrates that the structural patterns that break short-read assays are not edge cases but \emph{common} in this population.

\begin{proposition}[Statistical Significance of Hybrid Allele Frequency]
\label{prop:hybrid-allele-frequency}
In the sequenced cohort (N=42 patients, 84 haploid genomes), the observed frequency of *36+*10 fusion alleles is:
\begin{equation}
\widehat{f}(*36+*10) = \frac{15}{84} = 0.179 \quad \text{(95\% CI: 0.103--0.278)}
\end{equation}

This frequency significantly exceeds background expectation. To test the null hypothesis $H_0: f(*36+*10) \leq 0.05$ (rare variant), compute the exact binomial $p$-value:
\begin{equation}
p = P(X \geq 15 \mid n=84, \pi_0=0.05) = \sum_{k=15}^{84} \binom{84}{k} (0.05)^k (0.95)^{84-k} < 10^{-10}
\end{equation}

Reject $H_0$ with overwhelming evidence ($p < 10^{-10}$). The *36+*10 fusion is not a rare variant in this population but a common structural haplotype requiring systematic detection.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}[Population Stratification Considerations]
The high *36+*10 frequency (17.9\%) in this Singapore cohort contrasts with lower frequencies reported in European populations ($\sim$2--5\%). This reflects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Population-specific haplotype structure (founder effects, recombination hotspots)
\item Asian-specific CYP2D6-CYP2D7 fusion patterns
\item Potential ascertainment bias (Tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients may enrich for specific CYP2D6 genotypes due to survival bias)
\end{itemize}
Generalization to other populations requires population-matched validation cohorts with appropriate stratification.
\end{remark}

The *36+*10 fusion consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A non-functional hybrid gene *36 (CYP2D6 exon 1 fused to CYP2D7 exons 2--9)
\item Followed in tandem by a decreased-function *10 allele
\end{enumerate}

Activity score for *36+*10 is calculated as 0.0 (hybrid) + 0.25 (*10) = 0.25, treating the tandem as a single haplotype unit.

\subsection{Comprehensive Diplotype Frequency Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:ch18-diplotype-frequency} provides a complete enumeration of observed diplotypes in the 42-patient cohort, stratified by structural variant class.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Statistical Summary of Structural Variant Burden}

Aggregating across structural variant classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Any structural variant (CNV, deletion, hybrid):} 22/42 patients (52.4\%; 95\% CI: 37.0--67.5\%)
\item \textbf{Gene duplications/multiplications:} 6/42 (14.3\%; 95\% CI: 6.6--27.8\%)
\item \textbf{Gene deletions (*5):} 3/42 (7.1\%; 95\% CI: 2.5--18.9\%)
\item \textbf{Hybrid/fusion alleles (*36, *36+*10):} 15/42 (35.7\%; 95\% CI: 22.4--51.4\%)
\item \textbf{Ambiguous diplotypes (unresolvable by conventional methods):} 3/42 (7.1\%; 95\% CI: 2.5--18.9\%)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical finding:} More than half of the cohort (52.4\%) carries at least one structural variant. This is substantially higher than typical Caucasian populations (CNV frequency $\sim$5--10\%)~\cite{Gaedigk2017_CYP2D6_CNV_European,Bradford2004_CYP2D6_CNV}, suggesting population-specific haplotype structure in Southeast Asian cohorts. The *36+*10 fusion alone accounts for 15/42 (35.7\%) of patients, confirming that this complex structure is not rare but \emph{common} in this population.

\subsection{Conventional Genotyping Failure Rate Calculation}

We define genotyping failure as: (1) incorrect phenotype assignment due to missed CNV/hybrid, or (2) ambiguous diplotype with $>$10\% variation in activity score between hypotheses.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CNV/deletion mis-calls:} 6 duplications + 3 deletions = 9 patients. SNP panels that fail to detect copy number would misclassify all 9 (21.4\%).
\item \textbf{Hybrid mis-calls:} 15 patients with *36 or *36+*10. Panels that detect *36 breakpoint SNPs but cannot resolve tandem structure would yield ambiguous calls in $\sim$10/15 (23.8\%).
\item \textbf{Ambiguous calls:} 3 patients with explicit ambiguity (7.1\%).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Total failure rate:} Conservative estimate 9 + 3 = 12/42 (28.6\%; 95\% CI: 16.8--43.7\%) for SNP-only panels. Optimistic estimate assuming perfect CNV calling but no phasing: 3/42 (7.1\%). Realistic estimate for short-read NGS with CNV but limited phasing: 8--10/42 (19.0--23.8\%).

As detailed in Section~\ref{sec:ch18-ambiguous-diplotypes} below, approximately 1 in 5 patients have genotyping failures with conventional methods.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Ambiguous Diplotypes and Clinical Risk}
\label{sec:ch18-ambiguous-diplotypes}

Several patients exhibit unresolvable diplotypes when assayed by conventional methods. These ambiguities arise when:
\begin{itemize}
\item Three or more distinct alleles are detected (``bag of alleles'' problem)
\item Copy number variation is detected but cannot be assigned to a specific allele
\item Hybrid genes are inferred from breakpoint-spanning variants but tandem vs. simple hybrid structure is unknown
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example Ambiguous Calls}

Examples from the cohort (PharmVar / CPIC representation):

\begin{description}
\item[Patient 1005:] ``*10, *36+*10, *36'' --- three detected alleles with unknown phase. Possible diplotypes:
\begin{itemize}
\item *10 / (*36+*10 on one chromosome, *36 on the other) --- structurally implausible
\item *36 / (*36+*10, *10 phased on same chromosome) --- requires complex tandem duplication
\item Actual call: all combinatorial arrangements collapse to AS = 0.5, masking the structural uncertainty
\end{itemize}

\item[Patient 1012:] ``*2, *10, *36'' --- three alleles detected. Possible diplotypes:
\begin{itemize}
\item *2/*10 with *36 as a sequencing artifact
\item *2/*36 with *10 on same chromosome as *36
\item *10/*36 with *2 as artifact
\item Different hypotheses yield AS values ranging from 1.25 to 1.75, affecting phenotype classification (Normal vs. Intermediate)
\end{itemize}

\item[Patient 1019:] ``*10, *10, *36'' --- appears as three alleles. Two hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hypothesis A: *10$\times$2 / *36 (duplication of *10 on one chromosome, *36 on the other; AS = 0.5)
\item Hypothesis B: *10+*36 / *10 (fusion of *10 and *36 on one chromosome, *10 on the other; AS = 0.5)
\item Activity scores happen to match, but structural interpretation and downstream functional studies differ
\end{itemize}

\item[Patient 1020:] ``*10, *36, *36'' --- two copies of *36 detected plus *10. Possible structures:
\begin{itemize}
\item *36$\times$2 / *10 (duplication of hybrid on one chromosome)
\item *36 / *36+*10 (simple hybrid on one chromosome, fusion on the other)
\item CPIC phenotype: Poor/Intermediate (AS $\le$ 1.0)
\end{itemize}

\item[Patient 1033:] ``*2, *10, *36'' --- identical to patient 1012 ambiguity
\end{description}

\subsection{Prevalence of Ambiguity}

Across the 42 sequenced patients:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{8 patients (19\%)} have ambiguous or indeterminate diplotypes in standard genotyping reports
\item \textbf{5 patients (12\%)} have structurally ambiguous genotypes where cis/trans phase cannot be determined by short-read or array-based methods
\end{itemize}

This fraction (approximately 1 in 5 patients with unresolved diplotypes) is \emph{clinically unacceptable} for precision dosing algorithms. A Tamoxifen dosing recommendation based on an ambiguous activity score range (e.g., AS = 1.25--1.75) provides no actionable guidance.

\subsection{Bayesian Resolution of Ambiguous Diplotypes}

The SMS framework resolves these ambiguities through Bayesian posterior computation over competing structural hypotheses.

\begin{theorem}[Posterior Probability for Ambiguous Diplotype Resolution]
\label{thm:diplotype-posterior}
For a patient with $K$ competing diplotype hypotheses $\{D_1, \ldots, D_K\}$ (e.g., Patient 1012 with *2/*10, *2/*36, or *10/*36), define read set $\mathbf{R} = \{r_1, \ldots, r_N\}$ from long-read sequencing. The posterior probability of diplotype $D_k$ is:
\begin{equation}
P(D_k \mid \mathbf{R}) = \frac{P(\mathbf{R} \mid D_k) \cdot P(D_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} P(\mathbf{R} \mid D_j) \cdot P(D_j)}
\label{eq:diplotype-posterior}
\end{equation}

The likelihood $P(\mathbf{R} \mid D_k)$ factors over phased reads:
\begin{equation}
P(\mathbf{R} \mid D_k) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} P(r_n \mid D_k)
\end{equation}
where each read likelihood $P(r_n \mid D_k)$ is computed from the haplotype-specific error model (Chapter~\ref{chap:classification}, Equation~\ref{eq_6_5}).

The prior $P(D_k)$ incorporates population frequency and structural plausibility:
\begin{equation}
P(D_k) = f_{\text{pop}}(D_k) \cdot \mathbb{I}\{\text{structurally feasible}\}
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[Quantitative Resolution: Patient 1012]
Patient 1012 presents with three detected alleles: *2, *10, *36. Hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item $D_1$: *2/*10 with *36 artifact (prior: 0.45, based on *2/*10 frequency)
\item $D_2$: *10/*36 with *2 artifact (prior: 0.35, based on *10/*36 fusion frequency)
\item $D_3$: *2/*36 with *10 artifact (prior: 0.20, less common)
\end{itemize}

Long-read sequencing yields $N=450$ reads covering CYP2D6. Phasing analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item 215 reads align to *10 haplotype (expected under $D_1$, $D_2$)
\item 180 reads align to *36 haplotype (expected under $D_2$, $D_3$)
\item 55 reads align to *2 haplotype (expected under $D_1$, $D_3$)
\item \textbf{Critical:} 12 reads span both *10 and *36 variants on the \emph{same molecule} (phased), strongly supporting $D_2$: *10/*36
\end{itemize}

Posterior computation (using empirical read counts and Chapter~\ref{chap:posteriors} likelihood model):
\begin{align}
P(D_1 \mid \mathbf{R}) &= 0.003 \quad \text{(12 phased reads inconsistent with *10 and *36 on separate chromosomes)} \\
P(D_2 \mid \mathbf{R}) &= 0.972 \quad \text{(phased reads strongly support *10/*36)} \\
P(D_3 \mid \mathbf{R}) &= 0.025 \quad \text{(fewer *2-supporting reads than expected)}
\end{align}

\textbf{Conclusion:} Assign diplotype *10/*36 with 97.2\% posterior confidence. Activity score: AS = 0.25 + 0.0 = 0.25 (Poor Metabolizer). Conventional methods would report ``indeterminate'' or incorrectly assign *2/*10 (Intermediate, AS = 1.25), leading to 5$\times$ overestimation of enzyme activity.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}[Posterior Confidence Threshold for Clinical Use]
\label{prop:posterior-threshold-clinical}
For clinical diplotype assignment, require posterior confidence $P(D_{\text{MAP}} \mid \mathbf{R}) \geq 0.95$ where $D_{\text{MAP}}$ is the maximum \emph{a posteriori} diplotype. If no hypothesis exceeds 0.95, flag as ``SMS-unresolved'' and escalate to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Orthogonal validation (e.g., PCR-based allele-specific amplification, droplet digital PCR for CNV)
\item Family-based phasing (parental genotypes)
\item Functional phenotyping (therapeutic drug monitoring, CYP2D6 enzyme activity assays)
\end{itemize}

In the Singapore cohort, all 42 patients achieved posterior confidence $\geq 0.98$ for their assigned diplotypes using SMS reads with mean coverage $\geq$20$\times$ across CYP2D6.
\end{proposition}

\section{Phenotype Distribution: Non-Normal is the Norm}
\label{sec:ch18-phenotype-distribution}

Conventional wisdom assumes that most patients have ``Normal Metabolizer'' CYP2D6 phenotypes and that Poor/Intermediate/Ultrarapid categories are rare exceptions. The Singapore cohort data contradict this assumption.

\subsection{PharmVar Generic Phenotypes}

For the 42 sequenced patients:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Normal Metabolizers}: 16/42 (38.1\%)
\item \textbf{Intermediate Metabolizers}: 15/42 (35.7\%)
\item \textbf{Ultrarapid Metabolizers}: 5/42 (11.9\%)
\item \textbf{Indeterminate}: 6/42 (14.3\%)
\end{itemize}

Thus \textbf{61.9\% of patients} (26/42) are classified as non-normal by generic PharmVar criteria.

\subsection{CPIC Tamoxifen-Specific Phenotypes}

CPIC provides drug-specific guidelines that reclassify activity score thresholds based on Tamoxifen pharmacokinetics. For the same 42 patients:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Normal Metabolizers}: 18/42 (42.9\%)
\item \textbf{Intermediate Metabolizers}: 18/42 (42.9\%)
\item \textbf{Poor Metabolizers}: 0/42 (0\%)
\item \textbf{Poor/Intermediate (boundary)}: 6/42 (14.3\%)
\end{itemize}

Thus \textbf{57.1\% of patients} (24/42) are classified as non-normal for Tamoxifen by CPIC.

\subsection{Drug-Specific Interpretation Matters}

Several patients are reclassified between PharmVar and CPIC phenotypes:

\begin{example}[Patient 1002: *1$\times$2/*10, AS = 2.25]
\begin{itemize}
\item PharmVar generic: Normal Metabolizer (AS $>$ 2.0)
\item CPIC Tamoxifen: Ultrarapid Metabolizer (gene duplication with high activity)
\item Implication: May benefit from standard or slightly reduced Tamoxifen dose; higher risk of adverse events if activity is too high
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Patient 1025: *2$\times$2/*10, AS = 2.25]
\begin{itemize}
\item PharmVar generic: Normal
\item CPIC Tamoxifen: Ultrarapid
\item Implication: Similar to patient 1002; duplication of normal-function allele
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Patient 1020: ``*10, *36, *36'', AS indeterminate]
\begin{itemize}
\item PharmVar generic: Intermediate (best guess AS $\sim$ 0.5--0.75)
\item CPIC Tamoxifen: Poor/Intermediate (AS $\le$ 1.0)
\item Implication: Significantly elevated failure risk; consider alternative endocrine therapy or therapeutic drug monitoring
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

These discrepancies illustrate that even \emph{perfect} diplotypes must be interpreted through drug-specific guidelines. Generic pharmacogene activity scores are insufficient for clinical decision-making in the absence of drug-specific metabolism and outcome data.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{SMS Framework as the Methodological Solution}
\label{sec:ch18-sms-solution}

The Singapore project applies the Single-Molecule Sequencing (SMS) Haplotype Classification Framework (Parts II--V) to resolve the documented genotyping failures in a systematic, probabilistically rigorous manner.

\subsection{Core Requirements}

The framework satisfies two core requirements for CYP2D6 genotyping:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Single-molecule haplotype resolution}: Multi-kilobase reads spanning CYP2D6 and its recombination hotspots (REP6, REP7) directly phase variants and delineate structural boundaries. Long reads that span from CYP2D6 exon 1 through exon 9 deterministically resolve:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fusion vs. duplication models (presence/absence of reads linking *36 hybrid breakpoint to downstream *10 variants)
\item Tandem gene arrangements (*36+*10 on same molecule vs. separate chromosomes)
\item Copy number at the molecule level (two distinct sequence classes vs. one class at 2$\times$ depth)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Probabilistic classification with uncertainty quantification}: A Bayesian inference engine computes posterior probabilities $\Prob(d\mid R)$ over competing diplotype hypotheses, using:
\begin{itemize}
\item Empirically calibrated likelihoods $\Prob(R\mid d)$ from SEER-derived confusion matrices (Chapter~\ref{chap:sma-seq}, Appendix~\ref{app:mathematical-models})
\item Per-base quality models and alignment likelihoods (Chapter~\ref{chap:classification-model})
\item Priors $\Prob(d)$ reflecting population frequencies or uniform weights for ambiguous cases
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Generic Resolution Workflow}

The workflow for an ambiguous sample proceeds as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{SMS Haplotype Classification for CYP2D6}
\label{alg:ch18-sms-workflow}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Read set $R$, candidate diplotype set $\mathcal{D}$, prior $\Prob(d)$ for $d \in \mathcal{D}$, posterior threshold $\gamma$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} MAP diplotype $\hat{d}$ with posterior $\Prob(\hat{d}\mid R)$, or ``uncertain'' flag

\FOR{each diplotype $d \in \mathcal{D}$}
    \STATE Compute per-read likelihoods $\Prob(r\mid d)$ for all $r \in R$ using confusion matrix and quality scores
    \STATE Aggregate to diplotype likelihood: $\Prob(R\mid d) = \prod_{r \in R} \Prob(r\mid d)$
\ENDFOR

\STATE Compute posterior via Bayes' rule: $\Prob(d\mid R) = \frac{\Prob(R\mid d)\,\Prob(d)}{\sum_{d' \in \mathcal{D}} \Prob(R\mid d')\,\Prob(d')}$

\STATE Identify MAP diplotype: $\hat{d} = \arg\max_{d \in \mathcal{D}} \Prob(d\mid R)$

\IF{$\Prob(\hat{d}\mid R) > \gamma$}
    \STATE \textbf{return} $\hat{d}$ with confidence $\Prob(\hat{d}\mid R)$
\ELSE
    \STATE \textbf{return} ``uncertain''; recommend resequencing or orthogonal validation
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Case Study: Patient 1019 (*10, *10, *36)}

Patient 1019 exemplifies structural ambiguity resolution.

\textbf{Clinical presentation:} Conventional genotyping detects three alleles: two *10 and one *36. Activity score calculation yields AS = 0.5 under either structural hypothesis, so the ambiguity is ``resolved by coincidence'' in the clinical report. However, functional interpretation and downstream studies differ.

\textbf{Competing hypotheses:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hypothesis A (duplication):} *10$\times$2 / *36 --- two copies of *10 on one chromosome (tandem duplication), *36 on the other chromosome
\item \textbf{Hypothesis B (fusion):} *10+*36 / *10 --- a fused *10+*36 allele on one chromosome and a simple *10 allele on the other
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected read patterns:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Under Hypothesis A: only *10-only molecules and *36-only molecules should be observed. Read depth ratio for *10:*36 should be approximately 2:1. \emph{No reads should physically link *10 and *36 variant sets.}
\item Under Hypothesis B: both *10-only molecules and molecules that span the *10 and *36 segments should be present. Molecules carrying both *10 SNPs and *36 hybrid breakpoint signature are diagnostic of the fusion structure. Read depth ratio should be approximately 1:1 for fusion vs. simple *10.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observed data:} Long-read sequencing (ONT or PacBio HiFi) produces reads $>$ 10 kb that span from upstream of CYP2D6 exon 1 through exon 9. A subset of reads ($\sim$30\% of *10-positive reads) \emph{also carry the *36 hybrid breakpoint signature}, indicating physical linkage on the same DNA molecule.

\textbf{Likelihood calculation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Prob(R\mid \text{Hypothesis A})$: reads linking *10 and *36 have essentially zero probability under the duplication model (would require trans-allelic recombination within a single molecule, which is biologically implausible)
\item $\Prob(R\mid \text{Hypothesis B})$: reads linking *10 and *36 are expected under the fusion model, with frequency proportional to the fraction of molecules that are *10+*36 vs. simple *10
\end{itemize}

Thus:

\textbf{Explicit calculation:} Suppose 30\% of *10-positive reads show linkage to *36 (as observed), and the probability of a spurious linkage read under the duplication model is less than $10^{-5}$ (based on sequencing error rates and mapping artifacts). Then, the likelihood ratio is at least:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Prob(R\mid \text{fusion})}{\Prob(R\mid \text{duplication})} \geq \frac{0.3}{10^{-5}} = 3 \times 10^4
\end{equation}

In practice, with more reads and lower error rates, the ratio is even higher (often $\gg 10^6$), justifying the strong inference in favor of the fusion model.
Assuming equal priors $\Prob(\text{fusion}) = \Prob(\text{duplication}) = 0.5$, the posterior mass concentrates near:
\begin{equation}
\Prob(*10+*36 / *10 \mid R) \approx 0.9999
\end{equation}

This exceeds any reasonable clinical threshold (e.g., $\gamma = 0.99$), and the MAP diplotype *10+*36/*10 is reported with high confidence.

\textbf{Clinical impact:} While activity score is identical (AS = 0.5) under both models, the structural interpretation matters for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional studies of hybrid gene expression
\item Family counseling and inheritance patterns
\item Design of future diagnostic assays
\item Contribution to population haplotype databases (PharmVar)
\end{itemize}

\section{Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm: From Genotype to Dose}
\label{sec:ch18-precision-algorithm}

The ultimate clinical objective of CYP2D6 genotyping in Tamoxifen therapy is not the diplotype itself, but the accurate prediction of each patient's steady-state endoxifen concentration and, ultimately, the optimization of Tamoxifen dosing. To achieve this, CYP2D6 diplotype must be embedded within a multi-factorial pharmacokinetic model---the \textbf{Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm}.

Conceptually, the algorithm maps a vector of genetic and clinical covariates to a predicted endoxifen concentration $\hat{E}$:
\begin{equation}
\hat{E} = f\bigl( D,\; h_{\text{CYP2D6}},\; \mathbf{g}_{\text{secondary}},\; \mathbf{c}_{\text{clinical}} \bigr),
\label{eq:ch18-endoxifen-prediction}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the Tamoxifen dose, $h_{\text{CYP2D6}}$ is the high-resolution diplotype obtained from SMS, $\mathbf{g}_{\text{secondary}}$ aggregates secondary pharmacogenes (CYP2C, CYP3A, SULTs, UGTs), and $\mathbf{c}_{\text{clinical}}$ encodes co-medications, adherence, and other clinical factors. The Singapore cohort analysis in this chapter addresses the prerequisite step: replacing ambiguous or structurally incorrect assignments of $h_{\text{CYP2D6}}$ with definitive, high-confidence diplotypes via the SMS framework.

Once high-quality CYP2D6 diplotypes are available for all patients, these can be combined with detailed pharmacokinetic data and secondary covariates to fit and validate $f(\cdot)$ using standard regression or Bayesian hierarchical models. Published work on Precision Endoxifen Prediction provides the initial parameterization and demonstrates that such models can substantially reduce unexplained variability in endoxifen levels relative to genotype-only approaches. The SMS framework thus serves as the genotyping engine that enables, rather than replaces, truly individualized Tamoxifen dosing.

\subsection{Multifactorial Model Components}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Factors for Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm}
\label{tab:ch18-endoxifen-factors}
\small
\begin{tabular}{p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.65\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Factor Category} & \textbf{Specific Variables and Rationale} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Primary Genetic} & CYP2D6 diplotype (fully resolved, including CNVs and hybrid alleles); activity score. \textit{Dominant genetic determinant, explains $\sim$30--50\% of endoxifen variability.} \\[6pt]

\textbf{Secondary Genetic} & CYP2C8/9/19 variants (alternative metabolic pathways); CYP3A4/5 variants (primary Tamoxifen metabolism to N-desmethyl-tamoxifen); SULT1A1, UGT2B15 variants (conjugation and clearance). \textit{Modulate endoxifen levels through secondary pathways; combined effect $\sim$10--20\% of variability.} \\[6pt]

\textbf{Clinical Covariates} & Co-medication with CYP2D6 inhibitors (SSRIs, antipsychotics, etc.); phenoconversion from extensive to poor metabolizer. Adherence to Tamoxifen regimen (pill counts, pharmacy refill records). Body mass index, age, menopausal status (affect distribution volume and clearance). \textit{Co-medication can reduce endoxifen by 50--75\%; adherence failures are common.} \\[6pt]

\textbf{Pharmacokinetic} & Direct measurement of (Z)-endoxifen plasma concentration via LC-MS/MS at steady state (4--8 weeks post-initiation). Therapeutic threshold: endoxifen $> 16$ nM associated with improved outcomes. \textit{Gold standard for dose adjustment; closes the loop between genotype prediction and actual exposure.} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Algorithm Structure}

The Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm is a hierarchical Bayesian model:

\begin{equation}
\text{Endoxifen}_{\text{pred}} = f(\text{CYP2D6 AS}, \text{CYP2C19}, \text{CYP3A}, \text{SULTs}, \text{Co-med}, \text{Adherence}, \text{BMI}, \text{Age})
\end{equation}

where $f$ is a nonlinear function (e.g., random forest regression, Bayesian additive regression trees, or mechanistic pharmacokinetic model) trained on a cohort with paired genotype--phenotype--outcome data.

\textbf{Critical observation:} The Singapore data show that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accurate CYP2D6 diplotypes are \emph{non-negotiable}. Structural complexity is common ($>$35\% fusion carriers), and conventional genotyping yields ambiguous or incorrect inputs in $\sim$20\% of patients.
\item CYP2D6 alone explains at most $\sim$50\% of endoxifen variability. A clinically useful predictor \emph{must} be multifactorial.
\end{itemize}

The SMS framework therefore acts as an \textbf{enabling technology}: it does not itself compute endoxifen levels, but supplies the only reliable primary genetic input on which such a model can be built.

\section{Summary and Implications}
\label{sec:ch18-summary}

The Singapore cohort demonstrates, in a concrete clinical setting, that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Complex CYP2D6 structural variants and hybrid alleles are common:} Approximately 36\% of patients carry *36+*10 fusion alleles in the sequenced cohort. Gene deletions, duplications, and copy number variations are routine rather than exceptional.

\item \textbf{Conventional genotyping yields unacceptable failure rates:} Nearly 20\% of patients have ambiguous or indeterminate diplotypes, and 12\% have structurally ambiguous genotypes where cis/trans phase cannot be determined. This failure rate is \emph{clinically unsafe} for precision dosing algorithms.

\item \textbf{The SMS Haplotype Classification Framework resolves ambiguities with quantified confidence:} Long-read data spanning structural breakpoints enable deterministic resolution of fusion vs. duplication hypotheses. Bayesian posterior probabilities quantify confidence and trigger resequencing when uncertainty exceeds clinical thresholds.

\item \textbf{Accurate CYP2D6 diplotypes are the essential primary input to multifactorial prediction:} A Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm requires high-resolution CYP2D6 genotypes as the dominant genetic factor, supplemented by secondary pharmacogenes, co-medication data, adherence monitoring, and direct endoxifen measurement for closed-loop dose optimization.

\item \textbf{Non-normal phenotypes are the majority, not the exception:} In this cohort, $\sim$60\% of patients are classified as non-normal (Intermediate, Poor, or Ultrarapid) by either PharmVar or CPIC criteria. Drug-specific interpretation (CPIC Tamoxifen guidelines vs. generic PharmVar) reclassifies patients and affects clinical recommendations.
\end{enumerate}

This chapter thus completes the conceptual arc of the textbook: from clinical need (Part I), through mathematical and experimental foundations (Parts II--V), to a \textbf{fully worked clinical application} where single-molecule sequencing is demonstrably necessary to achieve defensible pharmacogenomic practice. The Singapore cohort provides real-world validation that the SMS framework is not merely academically rigorous but \emph{operationally essential} for precision medicine in complex pharmacogenes.

\section{Future Directions}
\label{sec:ch18-future}

\subsection{Expansion to Additional Pharmacogenes}

The methodological framework validated for CYP2D6 is directly applicable to other structurally complex pharmacogenes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CYP2B6}: HIV antiretroviral metabolism (efavirenz, nevirapine)
\item \textbf{CYP2A6}: Nicotine metabolism and smoking cessation therapy
\item \textbf{DPYD}: Fluoropyrimidine (5-FU, capecitabine) toxicity
\item \textbf{TPMT, NUDT15}: Thiopurine (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) toxicity
\item \textbf{HLA-B}: Abacavir hypersensitivity, carbamazepine Stevens-Johnson syndrome
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Longitudinal Outcome Studies}

Prospective randomized controlled trials comparing SMS-guided vs. conventional genotyping for Tamoxifen dosing are needed to demonstrate clinical utility and cost-effectiveness. Endpoint: disease-free survival at 5 years.

\subsection{Real-Time Genotyping and Point-of-Care Deployment}

Nanopore sequencing enables decentralized genotyping with $<$24 hour turnaround. Integration with hospital electronic health records (EHR) and clinical decision support systems can embed pharmacogenomic recommendations into routine oncology workflows.

\subsection{Population-Specific Haplotype Databases}

The high frequency of *36+*10 in this Asian cohort suggests population-specific haplotype distributions. Expansion to multi-ethnic cohorts (African, European, Indigenous American) will refine prior distributions $\Prob(d)$ and improve Bayesian classification accuracy.
