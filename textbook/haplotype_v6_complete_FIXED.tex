% Executive Overview
\chapter*{Executive Overview}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Executive Overview}

This document presents a comprehensive, error-aware framework for the classification of genomic haplotypes from single-molecule DNA sequencing (SMS) data. Version 6.0 organizes the framework as an integrated system that spans mathematical modelling, experimental design, empirical error characterization, and clinical validation. The central problem is to transform noisy single-molecule signals into clinically defensible haplotype and diplotype calls with explicit, quantitative uncertainty.

At the mathematical core lies the \textbf{Pipeline Factorization Theorem}, which decomposes the full generative process into a sequence of conditional distributions $\Prob(h,g,u,d,l,\sigma,r) = \Prob(h)\,\Prob(g\mid h)\cdots\Prob(r\mid\sigma)$ linking haplotypes $h$ to basecalled reads $r$ via genomic molecules, mutations, fragmentation, library preparation, instrument signals, and basecalling. This factorization provides the state-space architecture used throughout Parts II--V (formalized in Appendix~\ref{app:mathematical-models}, Section~\ref{sec:app-f-pipeline-factorization}).

Among these terms, $\Prob(r\mid\sigma)$---the probability of a read given an instrument signal---is the most complex and opaque. In practice it is implemented by a deep neural network basecaller running in different accuracy/performance modes. The \textbf{SEER} (Sequencing Empirical Error Rate) framework and the \textbf{SMA-seq} (Single Molecule Accuracy sequencing) protocol are designed to make this abstract term empirically visible and auditable. SMA-seq establishes physical ground truth by sequencing plasmid standards whose sequences are known with high confidence; SEER converts the resulting data into confusion matrices, per-base error profiles, and calibrated quality scores that parameterize the likelihood functions used for haplotype classification.

The framework is therefore best understood not as a one-way pipeline, but as a \textbf{cyclical SMA-SEER system} for continuous improvement. In the \textit{Measure} phase, SMA-seq is used to generate reads from high-purity plasmid standards representing clinically relevant haplotypes. In the \textit{Model} phase, SEER constructs empirical confusion matrices and per-base error models, defines Single Molecule Accuracy (SMA), and quantifies basecaller miscalibration using metrics such as the quality overstatement fraction and expected calibration error. In the \textit{Improve} phase, these empirical models drive basecaller fine-tuning and recalibration, directly modifying $\Prob(r\mid\sigma)$. Finally, in the \textit{Deploy} phase, the improved models and validated error parameters are used to classify patient samples and to design next-generation standards, closing the loop.

\textbf{SMA-SEER as a Learning System for Clinical Genomics.} Viewed at the highest level, the SMA-SEER architecture functions as a \textit{learning system} for single-molecule sequencing technologies. Each iteration of the loop takes empirical observations from physical reference standards and clinical samples, updates the statistical model $\Prob(r\mid\sigma)$ and its derived likelihoods, and pushes improved basecallers and classification rules back into production. Over time, the framework converges toward higher Single Molecule Accuracy (SMA), better-calibrated quality scores, and sharper posterior distributions over haplotypes. This closed-loop behaviour is particularly important for complex loci such as \textit{CYP2D6}, where structural variants and hybrid alleles routinely defeat conventional assays. In Part~VI, the Singapore cohort case study demonstrates how this learning system transforms an initially unreliable pharmacogenomic test into a high-resolution, clinically defensible genotyping solution for Tamoxifen therapy.

A key theme running through the framework is the distinction between predicted and empirical quality. Modern basecallers output Phred-scaled quality scores $Q_i$ which, in principle, encode basewise error probabilities $p_i = 10^{-Q_i/10}$. SEER uses SMA-seq data to compute empirical read-level and per-base error rates, and to construct formal inequalities---such as the Phred averaging inequality---that clarify the relationship between the mean of Phred scores and the Phred of the mean error probability. These constructions underpin quality gates and calibration procedures throughout Parts IV and V and are collected in Appendices~\ref{app:core-equations} and \ref{app:mathematical-models}.

The framework is tightly coupled to physical constraints on experimental systems. Plasmid replication models establish a \textbf{Purity Constraint}: the true positive rate measured on a standard cannot exceed the fraction of molecules that are actually correct. Purity bounds, together with dual Cas9 cutting models and coverage calculations, provide quantitative guidance for experimental design, ensuring that observed accuracies and depth are physically attainable and that validation experiments have sufficient statistical power.

Finally, the framework is anchored in real clinical applications. In particular, the \textbf{Singapore CYP2D6 Tamoxifen cohort} provides a flagship demonstration of why long-read, haplotype-resolved genotyping is necessary and how the SMS framework solves a previously intractable problem. In this 75-patient cohort (42 sequenced), 19\% of patients receive ambiguous diplotype calls under conventional genotyping, and 36\% carry complex \textit{CYP2D6-CYP2D7} fusion alleles such as \textit{*36+*10} that are invisible to standard assays. Application of the SMS Haplotype Classification framework resolves these ambiguities with high posterior confidence, enabling the construction of a Precision Endoxifen Prediction Algorithm that integrates \textit{CYP2D6} diplotypes with additional genetic and clinical covariates.

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent Standard methods establish a performance baseline, but clinical applications demand maximum possible accuracy. This part presents three orthogonal strategies for pushing beyond baseline performance. Chapter~\ref{chap:sma-seq} introduces SMA-seq, an adaptive sequencing approach that concentrates depth on informative genomic regions. Chapter~\ref{chap:noisy-labels} develops robust machine learning techniques that extract accurate models from imperfect training data. Chapter~\ref{chap:basecaller-tuning} optimizes the fundamental error model by fine-tuning basecaller neural networks for haplotype-specific contexts. These advanced techniques combine to deliver classification accuracy approaching the fundamental purity ceiling established in Part~II.

This part establishes the validation infrastructure that transforms experimental techniques into defensible clinical assays. Chapter~\ref{chap:diplotype-validation} presents controlled mixture experiments using characterized reference materials to empirically measure classification accuracy across the diplotype space.

Chapter 16 outlines planned bacterial genomics applications.}

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent Chapters~\ref{chap:cyp2d6-pain-psychiatry} and \ref{chap:singapore-cohort} demonstrate that structural variants and phasing ambiguities in CYP2D6---which affect 15--35\% of patients in conventional genotyping across therapeutic areas---can be systematically resolved using single-molecule sequencing with quantified Bayesian posterior confidence. These clinical validations span oncology, pain management, and psychiatric pharmacotherapy, establishing that the SMS framework (Parts~II--V) is broadly applicable wherever accurate genotyping is essential for precision dosing and adverse event prevention. Chapter~\ref{chap:bacterial} outlines the extension of these methods to microbial genomics for strain typing and antimicrobial resistance profiling.

\noindent Successful clinical implementation requires not just validated methods (Parts II--V) and compelling use cases (Part VI), but also practical guidance for laboratory operations and business planning. Chapter~\ref{chap:sops} outlines the complete standard operating procedure framework needed for CLIA/CAP-compliant deployment, while Chapter~\ref{chap:economic} provides economic modeling templates for cost-effectiveness analysis and resource planning.
