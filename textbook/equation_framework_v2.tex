%% USAGE EXAMPLES
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Example 1: Simple equation in box
% \begin{eqbox}{Bayes' rule}
% \begin{equation}
% P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
% \label{eq:bayes}
% \end{equation}
% \end{eqbox}

% Example 2: Multi-line equation
% \begin{eqbox}{System of equations}
% \begin{align}
% x + y &= 5 \\
% 2x - y &= 1
% \end{align}
% \end{eqbox}

% Example 3: Variable table
% \begin{vartable}
% \varrow{$x$}{Position}{meters}{Measured by GPS}
% \varrow{$v$}{Velocity}{m/s}{Computed from position derivative}
% \end{vartable}

% Example 4: Variable box
% \begin{varbox}{$\lambda$}
% \textbf{Physical description.}
% Mixture fraction of first haplotype.
%
% \textbf{Units.}
% Dimensionless, range [0,1].
%
% \textbf{Measurement.}
% Estimated via EM algorithm.
%
% \textbf{Example.}
% For balanced diploid: $\lambda = 0.5$.
% \end{varbox}
