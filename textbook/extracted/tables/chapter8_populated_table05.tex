\toprule
\textbf{Problem} & \textbf{Likely Cause} & \textbf{Solution} \\
\midrule
No colonies after transformation & Inefficient ligation; incorrect antibiotic & Check insert:vector ratio (should be 2-3:1 molar); verify antibiotic matches plasmid resistance gene \\
\midrule
Colonies but all negative by PCR & Self-ligation of vector; incorrect primers & Increase insert:vector ratio; verify primers by BLAST; use vector with negative selection marker \\
\midrule
Insert present but wrong size & Off-target amplification; partial deletion & Re-design primers with higher specificity; use high-fidelity polymerase; gel-purify PCR product \\
\midrule
Sanger sequence doesn't match expected & Wrong template; PCR error; synthesis error & Sequence multiple clones; if consistent across clones, verify input sequence was correct \\
\midrule
Restriction digest unexpected pattern & Methylation blocking enzyme; partial digest & Use methylation-insensitive enzyme; increase enzyme amount or incubation time; verify enzyme is active \\
\midrule
Low plasmid yield from Dam$^-$ strains & Strain-specific growth deficiency & Increase culture volume; use richer media; try alternative Dam$^-$ strain (JM110 vs. SCS110) \\
