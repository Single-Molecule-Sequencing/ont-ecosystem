\textbf{Check} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
\midrule
Schema diff report & Documents that no unexpected columns appeared between
validation and production runs. \\
Read/alias reconciliation & Ensures \texttt{sample\_id}, barcode aliases, and
tracking-card entries match laboratory notebooks to prevent sample swaps. \\
Termination summary & Aggregates \texttt{end\_reason} counts for QA review,
closing the loop with Chapter~\ref{chap:qc-gates} pore-health metrics. \\
Optional module inventory & Records whether alignment, barcoding, duplex, or
adaptive-sampling modules were engaged so downstream automation can branch
correctly. \\
