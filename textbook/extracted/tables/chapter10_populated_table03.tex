\toprule
\textbf{Module cue} & \textbf{Operational action} \\
\midrule
\texttt{alignment\_*} columns present & Generate quick-on-target dashboards and
verify that reference genomes/targets match project manifests before launching
full alignments. \\
\texttt{barcode\_*} columns present & Enforce demultiplexing QC gates: confirm all
expected barcodes appear, and alert when \texttt{barcode\_type} marks a control
sample as a test subject. \\
\texttt{poly\_tail\_*} columns present & For RNA programs, summarize tail lengths by
library to confirm enzymatic steps behaved as expected and adjust trimming
parameters for downstream aligners. \\
\texttt{adaptive\_sampling\_*} columns present & Cross-check target/untarget bed
files and log enrichment factors; missing columns imply the run defaulted to
standard sequencing even if adaptive sampling was requested. \\
\texttt{duplex\_parent\_*} columns present & Enable duplex yield reporting and
ensure downstream classifiers handle duplex consensus reads separately from
single-strand template/complement reads. \\
