\label{tab:corrective-actions}
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{4cm}p{6cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Failure Type} & \textbf{Stage} & \textbf{Corrective Action} \\
\midrule
Low library quality & Pre-sequencing & Re-extract DNA or re-prepare library with fresh reagents \\
Poor fragment distribution & Pre-sequencing & Adjust fragmentation protocol; optimize size selection \\
Low read yield & Sequencing & Check loading concentration; verify instrument calibration \\
Declining quality & Sequencing & Monitor pore/cluster health; consider terminating run early \\
Low alignment rate & Analysis & Check reference sequences; screen for contamination \\
Poor coverage uniformity & Analysis & Investigate capture bias; check PCR conditions \\
Failed controls & Analysis & Re-run with fresh standards; check confusion matrix \\
Sub-threshold posterior & Result & Increase sequencing depth; verify sample quality \\
Purity constraint violation & Result & Investigate contamination; verify reference accuracy \\
