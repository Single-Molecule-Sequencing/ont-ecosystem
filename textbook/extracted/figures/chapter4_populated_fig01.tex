\caption{Complete haplotype classification pipeline showing the flow from candidate haplotypes through genomic molecules, fragmentation, library preparation, sequencing, and basecalling to observed reads. Each arrow represents a conditional probability distribution. The confusion matrix (bottom) captures empirical error patterns measured via SMA-seq (Chapter~\ref{chap:sma-seq}).}
